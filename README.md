ABSTRACT:-
In this Object Oriented Programming Lab mini-project, we are going to demonstrate a GUI based Beverage Ordering System using java swing which can take the order from a user and generate a bill based on the inputs and prices of each beverage. The implementation is done on the Eclipse IDE.


INTRODUCTION:
In the Beverage Ordering System, the user gets a choice to select from four beverages like Juice, Water, Tea. Coffee. The users also have an option to customize their beverage by selecting from options depending on beverages. 


IMPLEMENTATION:-
 The system is designed using java swing to implement the GUI of the menu.
The menu GUI includes buttons, radio buttons, combobox classes
JPanel is used to show the title of the project on the title panel.
The combobox is used to select from small, medium and large sizes of beverages.
We have used the JRadiobutton class to select between beverages.
Also JTextField is used to receive input as the number of beverages to order.
Two JButtons i.e Add and order to do the same tasks are also used.
